<h1>CfunLang</h1><br>

<p><b>it will be the most extensive programming language adapted to systems made in cosmos</b></p>

You're probably wondering why you should choose CfunLang and not anything else:

* you don't have to implement their functionality yourself, for example (dotnet parser)

* this programming language is very similar syntactically to other very popular programming languages 

* it is very simple to adapt it to your needs, for example: Changing the function to be displayed from print to out takes 2 minutes, including reading what the code is about

* the gui in this programming language will be specifically for Cosmos

* one space won't break your code like TorchLang
